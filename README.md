# BioLearn AI - Frontend

This is the React frontend for the BioLearn AI platform, a specialized web application designed to replicate and enhance core features of Google Classroom for a research study.

## Overview

The platform facilitates teacher-led instruction, resource sharing, real-time communication (chat, video), and group-based collaboration. Its core feature is the integration of a Gemini AI assistant within small-group breakout sessions to aid in note-taking and concept exploration.

This frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to be connected to a Node.js/Express backend. Initially, it runs on mock data to allow for full UI/UX development and testing.

## Technology Stack (Frontend)

- **Framework:** React 18+
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Routing:** React Router (`HashRouter`)
- **State Management:** React Context API, `useState`, `useEffect`
- **Icons:** `lucide-react`
- **AI Integration:** `@google/genai` (for direct use in the frontend, to be proxied by the backend in production)

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd biolearn-ai-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the following variables. **Note:** The `API_KEY` is used directly by the frontend for development purposes. In a production environment, this key should be moved to the backend and accessed via a secure API endpoint.

    ```
    # Google Gemini API Key
    # This is used by the frontend for the AI Assistant feature.
    # IMPORTANT: For a real deployment, this key MUST be moved to the backend
    # to prevent exposure in the browser.
    API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    ```

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## Backend Implementation Guide

This frontend is designed to work with a backend that you will build. The `Implementation.md` file in this repository provides a detailed, phased guide for building the necessary Node.js/Express backend and connecting it to this frontend.

**It is critical to follow the `Implementation.md` guide.** It outlines:
1.  Setting up the backend project structure.
2.  Implementing user authentication endpoints.
3.  Creating APIs for class, student, and resource management.
4.  Integrating WebSockets (e.g., Socket.io) for real-time classroom state changes.
5.  Building endpoints for quiz management and analytics.
6.  Creating a secure proxy for Gemini AI API calls.

Each phase in the guide corresponds to a major feature set of the application. The frontend code in `src/services/` is structured to make swapping mock data functions with real API calls straightforward.
