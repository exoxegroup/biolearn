# Completed Implementation Phases

This document tracks the backend features that have been fully implemented according to the project's implementation plan.

---

### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Database Configuration

- **[COMPLETED]** Initialized Node.js project with all required dependencies.
- **[COMPLETED]** Set up TypeScript with a `tsconfig.json` file.
- **[COMPLETED]** Configured Prisma with a PostgreSQL database connection.
- **[COMPLETED]** Defined the complete database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- **[COMPLETED]** Ran initial database migrations to create all tables.
- **[COMPLETED]** Established the basic server structure with directories for routes, controllers, and middleware.

### Phase 2: Implement Authentication and User Management

- **[COMPLETED]** Implemented user registration and login endpoints in `authController.ts` with password hashing.
- **[COMPLETED]** Implemented a protected endpoint to get the current user's data (`/api/users/me`).
- **[COMPLETED]** Implemented a protected endpoint for users to complete their profiles (`/api/users/profile`).
- **[COMPLETED]** Created JWT-based authentication middleware (`authMiddleware.ts`) to secure protected routes.
- **[COMPLETED]** Connected the frontend authentication forms (`LoginPage.tsx`, `RegisterPage.tsx`) to the real backend endpoints, replacing mock API calls.

### Phase 3: Class Management

- **3.1: Teacher Class Management:** **[COMPLETED]**
  - Implemented endpoints for teachers to create, edit, and delete classes.
  - The `createClass` function now automatically generates a unique, shareable alphanumeric code for each new class.
  - All related routes are protected, ensuring only authenticated teachers can perform these actions.

- **3.2: Student Enrollment:** **[COMPLETED]**
  - Implemented the endpoint for students to enroll in a class using the unique class code.
  - The system correctly creates a `StudentEnrollment` record, linking the student to the appropriate class.
