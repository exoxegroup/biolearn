# Documentation Guide

This `docs` folder serves as the central repository for all project documentation. It is designed to create a seamless and professional workflow, especially when collaborating with an AI assistant.

## How to Use This System

1.  **Check the Status First:**
    *   Before starting any new task, always refer to the `STATUS.md` file.
    *   This file is the **single source of truth** for what has been completed and what the immediate next steps are.

2.  **Follow the Workflow:**
    *   The `STATUS.md` file also outlines a specific workflow for initiating tasks with an AI.
    *   **Your Role:** State the task you want to start (e.g., "Let's begin Phase 4.1").
    *   **AI's Role:** The AI will read `STATUS.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to understand the task, explain the necessary steps, and wait for your approval before proceeding.

3.  **Reference Other Documents:**
    *   `PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md`: Contains the "why" behind the features. It details the project's goals, user personas, and functional requirements.
    *   `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`: Contains the "how" for the features. It provides a detailed, phased technical guide for building the application.
    *   `TECHNICAL_GUIDES.md`: Contains specific setup instructions for services like Cloudinary and deployment guides for platforms like Render.

By following this structure, you ensure that you, your team, and any AI assistant are always aligned on the project's progress and next actions. The AI will be responsible for keeping the `STATUS.md` file updated as tasks are completed.
