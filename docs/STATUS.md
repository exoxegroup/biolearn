## 3. AI Collaboration Workflow

To ensure a smooth and efficient development process, we will adhere to the following workflow:

1.  **Task Initiation:** The user will state the task or phase they wish to begin (e.g., "Let's start Phase 4.2").
2.  **AI Explanation:** The AI assistant will first consult this `STATUS.md` file and the `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to understand the context. It will then provide a clear, concise explanation of the specific sub-tasks required to complete the objective.
3.  **User Review & Approval:** The user will review the AI's explanation. If any corrections or adjustments are needed, the user will provide them.
4.  **Execution:** Once the user is satisfied and gives the "go-ahead," the AI will execute the planned steps.
5.  **Status Update:** Upon successful completion and testing of a task or sub-task, the AI will update this `STATUS.md` file to reflect the progress, moving the completed item to the "Completed" section and outlining the new "Next Steps".
