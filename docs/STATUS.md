# Project Status & Workflow

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the BioLearn AI project's status. It serves as the single source of truth for tracking progress and defining the operational workflow between the user and the AI assistant.

## 1. Current Project Status

The project is developed in a structured, phased approach. The status of each phase is detailed below.

### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Database Configuration
- **[COMPLETED]** Initialized Node.js project with all required dependencies.
- **[COMPLETED]** Set up TypeScript with a `tsconfig.json` file.
- **[COMPLETED]** Configured Prisma with a PostgreSQL database connection.
- **[COMPLETED]** Defined the complete database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- **[COMPLETED]** Ran initial database migrations to create all tables.
- **[COMPLETED]** Established the basic server structure with directories for routes, controllers, and middleware.

### Phase 2: Implement Authentication and User Management
- **[COMPLETED]** Implemented user registration and login endpoints in `authController.ts` with password hashing.
- **[COMPLETED]** Implemented a protected endpoint to get the current user's data (`/api/users/me`).
- **[COMPLETED]** Implemented a protected endpoint for users to complete their profiles (`/api/users/profile`).
- **[COMPLETED]** Created JWT-based authentication middleware (`authMiddleware.ts`) to secure protected routes.
- **[COMPLETED]** Connected the frontend authentication forms (`LoginPage.tsx`, `RegisterPage.tsx`) to the real backend endpoints, replacing mock API calls.

### Phase 3: Class Management
- **3.1: Teacher Class Management:** **[COMPLETED]**
  - Implemented endpoints for teachers to create, edit, and delete classes.
  - The `createClass` function now automatically generates a unique, shareable alphanumeric code for each new class.
  - All related routes are protected, ensuring only authenticated teachers can perform these actions.
- **3.2: Student Enrollment:** **[COMPLETED]**
  - Implemented the endpoint for students to enroll in a class using the unique class code.
  - The system correctly creates a `StudentEnrollment` record, linking the student to the appropriate class.
- **3.3: YouTube Embed Integration:** **[COMPLETED]**
  - Implemented endpoints for uploading and retrieving YouTube materials in `materialController.ts`
  - Added URL parsing logic to convert YouTube watch URLs to embed format
  - Created `materialRoutes.ts` for material management endpoints
  - Integrated material routes into main server in `index.ts`
  - Verified YouTube URLs are correctly stored in Material table's `url` field
- **3.4: Resource Upload Integration (Cloudinary):** **[COMPLETED]**
  - Integrated Cloudinary for uploading PDF and DOCX files.
  - Updated materialController.ts to handle file uploads to Cloudinary instead of local storage.
  - Configured for deployment compatibility.

## 2. Next Steps

The immediate focus is to complete the remaining tasks in Phase 3.

### Phase 3: Implement Class Management
- **3.5:** Connect frontend pages like `TeacherDashboard.tsx` and `ClassroomPage.tsx` to the backend endpoints for resource management.
- **3.6:** Perform comprehensive end-to-end testing of Phase 3: **[COMPLETED]**
  - A teacher creates a class.
  - The teacher uploads a PDF and adds a YouTube link via the "Content" button on Teacher's dashboard.
  - Verify all data is correctly persisted in the database.
  - A student joins the class using the generated code. And once joined, the student can see the classes enrolled in.
 
Upon successful completion and verification of Phase 3, the project will proceed to **Phase 4: Implement Quiz Management**.

## 2. Next Steps

The immediate focus is to complete the remaining tasks in Phase 4.

### Phase 4: Implement Quiz Management
- **4.2:** Implement backend endpoints for quiz management
  - Create endpoints for teachers to create/edit/delete quizzes
  - Create endpoints for students to take quizzes
- **4.3:** Implement quiz grading system
  - Calculate scores automatically
  - Store results in database

## 3. AI Collaboration Workflow

To ensure a smooth and efficient development process, we will adhere to the following workflow:

1.  **Task Initiation:** The user will state the task or phase they wish to begin (e.g., "Let's start Phase 3.5").
2.  **AI Explanation:** The AI assistant will first consult this `STATUS.md` file and the `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to understand the context. It will then provide a clear, concise explanation of the specific sub-tasks required to complete the objective.
3.  **User Review & Approval:** The user will review the AI's explanation. If any corrections or adjustments are needed, the user will provide them.
4.  **Execution:** Once the user is satisfied and gives the "go-ahead," the AI will execute the planned steps.
5.  **Status Update:** Upon successful completion and testing of a task or sub-task, the AI will update this `STATUS.md` file to reflect the progress, moving the completed item to the "Completed" section and outlining the new "Next Steps".
