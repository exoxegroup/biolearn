# Project Status & Workflow

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the BioLearn AI project's status. It serves as the single source of truth for tracking progress and defining the operational workflow between the user and the AI assistant.

## 1. Current Project Status

The project is developed in a structured, phased approach. The status of each phase is detailed below.

### Phase 1: Environment Setup and Database Configuration
- **[COMPLETED]** Initialized Node.js project with all required dependencies.
- **[COMPLETED]** Set up TypeScript with a `tsconfig.json` file.
- **[COMPLETED]** Configured Prisma with a PostgreSQL database connection.
- **[COMPLETED]** Defined the complete database schema in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
- **[COMPLETED]** Ran initial database migrations to create all tables.
- **[COMPLETED]** Established the basic server structure with directories for routes, controllers, and middleware.

### Phase 2: Implement Authentication and User Management
- **[COMPLETED]** Implemented user registration and login endpoints in `authController.ts` with password hashing.
- **[COMPLETED]** Implemented a protected endpoint to get the current user's data (`/api/users/me`).
- **[COMPLETED]** Implemented a protected endpoint for users to complete their profiles (`/api/users/profile`).
- **[COMPLETED]** Created JWT-based authentication middleware (`authMiddleware.ts`) to secure protected routes.
- **[COMPLETED]** Connected the frontend authentication forms (`LoginPage.tsx`, `RegisterPage.tsx`) to the real backend endpoints, replacing mock API calls.

### Phase 3: Class Management
- **[COMPLETED] 3.1: Teacher Class Management:**
  - Implemented endpoints for teachers to create, edit, and delete classes.
  - The `createClass` function now automatically generates a unique, shareable alphanumeric code for each new class.
  - All related routes are protected, ensuring only authenticated teachers can perform these actions.
- **[COMPLETED] 3.2: Student Enrollment:**
  - Implemented the endpoint for students to enroll in a class using the unique class code.
  - The system correctly creates a `StudentEnrollment` record, linking the student to the appropriate class.
- **[COMPLETED] 3.3: YouTube Embed Integration:**
  - Implemented endpoints for uploading and retrieving YouTube materials in `materialController.ts`
  - Added URL parsing logic to convert YouTube watch URLs to embed format
  - Created `materialRoutes.ts` for material management endpoints
  - Integrated material routes into main server in `index.ts`
  - Verified YouTube URLs are correctly stored in Material table's `url` field
- **[COMPLETED] 3.4: Resource Upload Integration (Cloudinary):**
  - Integrated Cloudinary for uploading PDF and DOCX files.
  - Updated materialController.ts to handle file uploads to Cloudinary instead of local storage.
  - Configured for deployment compatibility.
- **[COMPLETED] 3.5 & 3.6: Frontend Integration and Testing:**
  - Connected frontend pages to backend endpoints for resource management.
  - Performed comprehensive end-to-end testing of Phase 3.

### Phase 4: Implement Quiz Management
- [COMPLETED] **4.1: Quiz Creation Endpoints:**
    - **Controller (`quizController.ts`):**
        - `updateQuiz`: Allow teachers to create/update Pre- and Post-tests with questions, options, correct answers, and time limits. Handle the option to reuse pre-test questions for the post-test.
    - **Routes (`quizRoutes.ts`):** Create protected routes for creating and updating quizzes.
- [COMPLETED] **4.2: Quiz Submission and Scoring:**
    - **Controller (`quizController.ts`):**
        - `getQuiz`: Fetch a quiz for a student to take (already implemented).
        - `submitQuiz`: Record student answers, calculate the score, and save it in the `StudentEnrollment` table.
    - **Routes (`quizRoutes.ts`):** Create protected routes for fetching and submitting quizzes.
- [COMPLETED] **4.3: Frontend Integration:**
    - Successfully connected frontend components (`ManageQuizzesPage.tsx`, `QuizEditor.tsx`, `PretestView.tsx`, and `PosttestView.tsx`) to the new backend endpoints.
- [COMPLETED] **4.4: Testing:**
    - Performed end-to-end testing of the entire quiz lifecycle.

### Phase 5: AI Assistant Integration
- [COMPLETED] **5.1: Group Management:**
    - **Controller (`groupController.ts`):** Created functions to assign students to groups within a class (`assignGroups`) and get group assignments (`getGroupAssignments`).
    - **Routes (`groupRoutes.ts`):** Created protected routes for group management.
    - **Integration:** Added group routes to main server in `index.ts`.
    - **Testing:** Successfully tested group assignment functionality with PowerShell commands - verified teachers can assign students to groups and retrieve group assignments.
- [PENDING] **5.2: Shared Notes Persistence:**
    - **Socket Event:** Create a `note:update` socket event handler.
    - **Logic:** When a note is updated, save the content to the `GroupNote` table and broadcast the new content to the other members of that specific group room.
- [PENDING] **5.3: AI Assistant Integration:**
    - **Controller (`aiController.ts`):** Create a `getAIResponse` function that takes a prompt from the client. It should use the Gemini API key from the server's `.env` file to generate content and return the response.
    - **Route (`aiRoutes.ts`):** Create a protected `POST /api/ai/query` route.
- [PENDING] **5.4: Frontend Integration:**
    - **UI:** Connect the student management UI to the `assignGroups` endpoint.
    - **Shared Notes:** Modify `SharedNotes.tsx` to use sockets for real-time updates.
    - **AI Assistant:** Modify `geminiService.ts` in the frontend to call the new secure `/api/ai/query` backend endpoint instead of the Google AI SDK directly. Remove the API key from the frontend environment.
- [PENDING] **5.5: Testing:**
    - **Local Tests:** A teacher assigns students to groups, students collaborate on notes, and students query the AI assistant.

## 2. Next Steps

The immediate focus is to continue **Phase 5.2: Shared Notes Persistence** with socket event handlers.

## 3. AI Collaboration Workflow

To ensure a smooth and efficient development process, we will adhere to the following workflow:

1.  **Task Initiation:** The user will state the task or phase they wish to begin (e.g., "Let's start Phase 4.2").
2.  **AI Explanation:** The AI assistant will first consult this `STATUS.md` file and the `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to understand the context. It will then provide a clear, concise explanation of the specific sub-tasks required to complete the objective.
3.  **User Review & Approval:** The user will review the AI's explanation. If any corrections or adjustments are needed, the user will provide them.
4.  **Execution:** Once the user is satisfied and gives the "go-ahead," the AI will execute the planned steps.
5.  **Status Update:** Upon successful completion and testing of a task or sub-task, the AI will update this `STATUS.md` file to reflect the progress, moving the completed item to the "Completed" section and outlining the new "Next Steps".
